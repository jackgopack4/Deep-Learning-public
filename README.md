# Deep Learning CS394D Project Repository

Code in private repository available upon request to avoid academic integrity concerns.

Includes individual assignments to develop DL/Computer Vision Models and final project.

Final project uses PyTorch model and visual-based approach with hand-tuned Python controller logic in order to "play" the Ice Hockey minigame in a modified version of PySuperTuxKart.

Convolutional network with a block-based structure was implemented, including Batch Normalization, Convolution, ReLU, as well as Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCE) in PyTorch framework

See the final project report here.
